# CAD

All CAD is done by `SolidWorks 2018`, but then upgraded to `SolidWorks 2021`, no error for now.

To adapt different versions of Solidworks, `eDrawing` is uploaded as well
The compressed file [sheet metal.rar](https://github.com/ValenQiu/SolarTracker/blob/main/CAD/sheet%20metal.rar) contains`.DXF` files for sheet metal
